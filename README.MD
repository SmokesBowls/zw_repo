Here’s a user-friendly README for your zw_repo, clearly explaining the Indie First license applies to the zW protocol infrastructure (not the demo calculator), and including easy install instructions and practical tips:

# zw_repo

**Zieglewagga Protocol Infrastructure**

## Overview

zw_repo contains the official implementation of the zW Protocol—a schema-agnostic, noise-tolerant protocol designed for flexible, robust data exchange and AI communication. The protocol prioritizes meaning over rigid labels and supports vocabulary remapping and extensibility.

> **Note:**  
> The Indie First license applies to the zW Protocol and infrastructure. It does **not** apply to the demo calculator found in `tools/zw_calc_demo.py`.

---

## Features

- **Schema-Agnostic:** Intent is primary, labels are secondary.
- **Extensible:** Add new terms or concepts anytime.
- **Vocabulary Remapping:** Redefine meanings mid-stream.
- **Noise Tolerance:** Handles unexpected/messy data gracefully.
- **Deterministic Output:** Reliable results, even with chaotic input.

## Installation (Easy Setup)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SmokesBowls/zw_repo.git
   cd zw_repo
   ```

2. **Install Python Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Demo Calculator**
   ```bash
   python tools/zw_calc_demo.py
   ```

---

## Quick Start

- Try out flexible input examples like:
  ```
  add 2 and 7
  subtract five from twenty
  remap plus to add
  average of 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42
  ```

- Extend the protocol in your own Python projects by importing its modules and following the examples.
